Purple Orc came about as a combination of two things: Gaming and Service. What if we created and backed a cryptocurrency that had gamers giving back to their community? What if this currency could be used to purchase board games, and introduce new players to old classics? What if we could pay our DMs to give us amazing campaigns? What if they were prizes for the next Lorcana tournament? What if community members could pay with PORC to have their grass cut, or leaves raked? Can one little coin with a purple goofball on it leave a sparkly fingerprint on the world? Don't know, but I'm game if you are.
